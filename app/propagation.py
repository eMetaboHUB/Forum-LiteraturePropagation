    Args:
        index (integer): the index of the specie if the metabolic network
        data (pandas.DataFrame): data related to corpus size of each compound in the metabolic network and their co-occurence with the studied MeSH 
        p (float): The general probability to observed a mention of a compound in an article, also involving the MeSH.
        alpha_prior (float): The alpha parameter of the prior distribution
        beta_prior (float): The beta parameter of the prior distribution
        seq (float, optional): The step used to create a x vector of probabilities (for plotting distribution only). Defaults to 0.0001.
        plot (bool, optional): Does the function has to plot prior and posterior distributions ?. See plot_prior_mix_distributions and plot_distributions. Defaults to False.
        weigth_limit (float, optional): If the weight of a compound in the prior mixture is lower than this threshild, the compound is removed from the mixture. it may be usefull when plotting distribution as there could be a lot of compounds involved in the mxiture. Defaults to 1e-5.

    Returns:
        [collection]: A collection with:
        - Mean (float): The mean of the posterior distribution. 
        - CDF (float): The probability P(p <= p(M)) derived from the CDF of the posterior distribution. The more this probability is low, the more we are certain that the mean of the posterior distribution is higher than the general probability to observed the MeSH (independance hypothesis)
        - Log2FC (float): The log2 fold change between the mean of the posterior distribution and the general probability to observed the MeSH
        - priorCDFratio: The log2 ratio of the CDF probabilities P(p <= p(M)) obtained between the initial prior and the mixture prior. When this value is high, it indicates that the studied MeSH is more frequent than usual in the neiborhood of the targeted compound. This value is correlated with the CDF. This value is NaN is the neighborhood can't provide information, as these both prior will be the same
